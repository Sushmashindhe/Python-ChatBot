# Python-ChatBot
This project is an AI-powered chatbot built using Python, NLP, and a trained neural network model. It classifies user queries based on predefined intents from intents.json and generates accurate responses. The model is stored in data.pth, and a demo recording showcases its functionality. Lightweight and extensible for future improvements.
